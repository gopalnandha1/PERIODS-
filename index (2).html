  <h2>Take Care, You Are Strong Shreya ðŸ’—</h2>

  <h4> Shreya, I just want you to know that itâ€™s okay to pause, to rest, and to let your body do what it needs to do. Periods can be painful, exhausting, and overwhelming â€” but youâ€™re stronger than you know. This discomfort doesn't define you, your strength does. You're still the same amazing, kind-hearted, and beautiful soul â€” just a little more in need of comfort right now. I may not be able to take the pain away, but Iâ€™ll always be here with a warm word, a quiet hug, and whatever you need â€” even if itâ€™s just some silly jokes, hot tea, or peaceful silence. Take care of yourself, Shreya. You deserve all the love, care, and gentleness in the world â€” especially today.</h4>
